// Restore .btn-default et al.
// We do this in _declarations.scss instead of up in _variables.scss because
// it's important that the `default` color come first in the $theme-colors map,
// so .btn-default comes before .btn-primary in the generated CSS and thus has
// lower priority.

// Need to declare $default with a null value here so it has the right scope
// (i.e. not scoped to the inside of the if/else branches)
$default: null !default;

// I don't like the default secondary color, as it's too big a departure from
// the bootstrap 3 coloring (dark instead of light grey). But secondary is
// semantically the closes match to default. So if secondary hasn't changed, use
// a lighter grey for default; but if a custom secondary is in use, then use
// that for default. (Another option would be to simply change the secondary
// color.)

// Cards are white by default, but we want a smarter default for .well
// that it appears similar to $light with no theming, but is also smart enough
// to respond to changes in foreground color
